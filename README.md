## 📌 What This Account Does

This is a **specialized deployment & archival account** dedicated to:

### 🎯 Core Missions

**1. ☁️ Cloud Deployment Hub**
- Forked projects optimized for one-click deployment on Vercel, Netlify, and other platforms
- Keep my main GitHub account clean and uncluttered from deployment forks
- Quick prototyping and production-ready deployments
- CI/CD pipelines pre-configured and battle-tested

**2. 💾 Backup & Archive Repository**
- Safeguard against force majeure scenarios (original authors deleting repositories)
- Preserve important open-source projects and tools
- Prevent knowledge loss when upstream repositories disappear
- Serve as an emergency fallback source

### 🏗️ Why Separate?
